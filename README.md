# US-cause-of-death-prevalence

The goal of this project was to use 3 datasets to compare the actual vs. perceived prevalence of different causes of death in the US from 2004-2016. 

The CDC dataset contained data of actual causes of death in the US. 
The Google dataset contained search data for causes of death in the US. 
The NYT datasets contained the reporting frequency of different causes of death in the US in the NYT.
